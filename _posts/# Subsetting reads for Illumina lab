# Subsetting reads for Illumina lab

I want reads that have R500 and IMB211
I want reads that can be split by barcode
I want enough depth to see something interesting by IGV

How to do this?

I could just take the first 200K reads from one fastQ file and then provide a bam file later.  Doesn't seem like much fun.

Subset reads from a chromosome, figure out the read names, grab them from the initial fastq file...

I will try that

Running out of time.

For now Take first Million reads of  /iplant/home/shared/ucd.plantbio/maloof.lab/members/upendra/Parents_stuff/67.20110823.GH_lane1/s_1_1_sequence.txt

    head -n 4000000 s_1_1_sequence.txt > GH.lane67.fastq
