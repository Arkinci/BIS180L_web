Many of the following labs will be performed using [R](http://www.r-project.org/).  R is an open-source, multi-platform statistical programming langauge.  Many (bio)statisticians develop their algorithims in R and therefore it contains many of the latest techniques.  A related project, [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) extends R for bioinformatics analsyis.  While a command-line interface may seem old-fashioned it allow much greater flexibilty than is typically available through graphical user interfaces.

There are a number of different interfaces available for R.  We will use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/) to interface with R running on your linux instance.  R and RStudio are also available for Mac and PC computers.

If you want to use R, Bioconductor, and Rstudio on your own computer you can do so for free, by following the links above.

## Install curl

We will be using a tutorial in R that relies on the Linux curl libraries.  Please open the terminal and type:

    sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev
    
(Not needed on Macintosh.  Unknown on PCs)

## Introduction to R
Click on the Rstudio Icon ![Rstudio icon](images/Rstudio_logo.png) at the bottom of your screen.
You will see a 3 or 4-paned window appear.  

The lower left panel is the R console, where you can directly type commands into R.  More about the other panes later.
### The swirl tutorial

We will start with an interactive tutorial called [swirl](http://swirlstats.com/).  The first step is to install swirl.  This only needs to be done once per computer.

  install.packages("swirl")
  
Next tell R that you want to load the swirl package

  library(swirl)

And start the swirl tutorial.

    swirl()

When given the choice, choose "1: R Programming: The basics of programming in R".  Then "1: R Programming" You should complete all 6 tutorials within this course:

1. Basic Building Blocks
2. Sequences of Numbers
3. Vectors
4. Missing Values
5. Subsetting Vectors
6. Matrices and Data Frames

Complete the `swirl()` tutorials before continuing

## More about RStudio

You will record your work today in an R-script file.  Create a new file by clicking on the icon with a "+" symbol, upper left, or going to the file menu, or typing ctrl-shift-N.  This will create a new panel, upper left, in your RStudio window.

There are total of four panes in the RStudio window.

* Upper left: a text editor.  You will write your scripts/commands here.
* Lower left: the command line interface, or console.  While you can type commands here, I **strongly** encourage you instead to type them in the text editor mentioned above.  Output will appear here.
* Upper Right: This shows *objects* in your *workspace*.  Think of objects as containers or variables that hold things.  More about this later.
* Lower Right: A multipurpose window that can show:
  * Help
  * Plots
  * Files in your directory

Before we continue, lets start our script file with some information about what it is.
In this manual, code that you should type will shown in a grey block such as:

```{r ScriptHeader,tidy=FALSE}
#R Script for BIS180L, Unit 2, Day 1.
#Julin Maloof
#Started on April 17, 2014
```
Lines that begin with a pound sign `#` are comment lines and are ignored by R.  Type the text above into the script window in the upper left pane (replacing "Julin Maloof" with your name, and adding any additional information that you think is useful.

Save your new script file by choosing "Save" from the "File" pull-down menu or clicking on the disk icon.  Save the file in a new directory for today's work.

Now lets enter some simple R code:
```{r hello_world, results='hide'}
print("Hello World!")
```
Type the text above into the script (upper-left) window.  Then with the cursor still on that line, hold down the control key (CMD key on Mac) and press the enter or return key.  This causes R Studio to copy the text from your script file, paste it into the console and "execute" the code.

Now that you are done with the `swirl` tutorial you should **always** type your commands in the upper left window to create a script and also to keep a record of what you have done.

When I want to show you output from a command, it will be shown in a white box like this:
```{r hello_world2, echo=FALSE}
print("Hello World")
```
(but most often I will not show you the output)

What just happened?  In R you use *functions* to carry out tasks.  In the above code `print()` is a function.  Functions are always followed by a pair of parentheses that include the *arguments* to the function.  In the above code, `"Hello World!"` is the argument.

## Practice what you learned from `swirl()`

The exercises below will give you additional practice with the building blocks that you learned in `swirl()`

Save your code and answers in your script file.

Another function in R is `sum()`, which sums it arguments.

**EXERCISE 1:**  Use sum() to determine the sum of numbers from 2000 to 20000.  Provide your code and the actual sum in your answer.

### Objects
In `swirl` you learned about variables.  Another (and more inclusive) name for variables is *objects*. Objects in R are used to store data, results, and even functions.  The following should be familiar to you:
```{r objects, results='hide'}
a <- 5
b <- 2:20
a
b
```
**EXERCISE 2:** In one or two sentences, describe what the above code snippet it did.

You can list the objects in your workspace by using the `ls()` function.  Objects can be removed using the `rm()` function.  Objects are also shown in the upper right-hand pane.  Try:
```{r objects_part2, results='hide', eval=FALSE}
d <- "I just want to be deleted"
d
ls() #note that you have to include the parentheses for a function even if no arguments are needed.
rm(d)
ls()
d #generates an error because we removed it
```
Note that in the above snippet I again used the comment character "#".  Any text that follows a "#" is considered a comment and is not interpreted.  I highly recommend extensively commenting your code to explain what you are doing.  What makes sense today will seem like gibberish tomorrow.  Comments can help.

**EXERCISE 3:** Add the contents of a and b together and place the results in a new object.  Examine the result.  Include your code.  Try using both `sum()` and `+`; do you get different results?  If so, why?

In the `swirl()` tutorial you learned how to use the brackets [] to extract elements from objects.  Lets practice here.

**Exercise 4:** What is the sum of the 5th through 10th element of object b?  Provide your code and the sum. 


**Exercise 5:** What is the sum of the 3rd, 8th, and 10th element of b?  For both of these exercises should only need to have "b" in your code once.

### 2 Dimensional Objects
You were also introduced to 2-dimensional objects in `swirl()`.  Lets get a bit more practice with them here.  The matrix command makes 2-dimensional objects.  When extracting from a multi-dimensional object you must specify both dimensions within the square brackets.
```{r 2d_objects, results='hide'}
m <- matrix(data=1:25,ncol=5,byrow=T)
m
m[5,5]
```
**Exercise 6:** When extracting from a 2-dimensional object, which number specifies rows and which specifies columns?  What does `m[3,]` do?  How can you extract the 3rd, 4th and 5th columns of m together as one object?

Type `cbind(m,101:105). 

**Exercise 7:** What does the cbind command do?  Create a new object "n" where the first row is a new row of numbers (your choice) and the following rows are the followed by the m matrix. Extra credit: do the same but reverse the order of the rows from m.

## Analyzing the BLAST results from Unit 1

Now that you have some R fundamentels lets deploy them on the blast results from Ian's Section

### Data import
The easiest way to bring data into R is in a .csv(comma-separated values) or .tsv (tab-separated values) files.  Today we already have the file in the correct format.  In the furture if you need to import other data into R, both of these formats can be created in Excel (choose "Save As..." in Excel and select the correct format).  The relevant R import functions are `read.delim()` and `read.csv()`

Using the linux terminal, create a alias (symbolic link) to your fly vs. worm blast results from lab2.

If you no longer have the file you can download it from SmartSite.

Back in R, import the file:
```{r import_blast, results='hide'}
fly.worm <- read.delim("../data/fly2worm.blastout",header=F)
#change the file name and path to match whatever you used.
#the header=F argument tells R that the first row contains data, not column names
#takes a while to read in this large data set.
```
Look in the right hand pane and you can see a brief description of the data.  There are 204350 rows and 22 columns.  It is important that you look at files after they have been read in with the `head()` and `summary()` functions.
```{r summary, eval=FALSE}
head(fly.worm) #first six rows 
summary(fly.worm) #summarizes the first 20 columns
```

It is a bit of a bummer that we do not have appropriate column names.  The columm name info can be found [here](http://blast.advbiocomp.com/doc/tabular.html).  We can assign column names as follows:
```{r colnames, results='hide'}
colnames(fly.worm) <- c("query_id",
                        "subject_id",
                        "E_value",
                        "N",
                        "Sprime",
                        "S",
                        "align_length",
                        "number_identical",
                        "number_positive",
                        "number_mismatched",
                        "percent_ident",
                        "percent_pos",
                        "query_gaps",
                        "query_gap_length",
                        "subject_gaps",
                        "subject_gap_length",
                        "query_frame",
                        "query_start",
                        "query_end",
                        "subject_frame",
                        "subject_start",
                        "subject_end")
```
Now lets try the `head()` and `summary()` functions again.
```{r summary2, eval=FALSE}
head(fly.worm)
summary(fly.worm)
```
You can see that `summary()` has provided some nice summary statistics for each numeric column.

Using what you learned from `swirl()` answer the following questions.  Show your code.

**Exercise 8**:
* How many hits have an e-value of 0?  
* How many have hits have a percent identity > 50?
* Recalculate the above values but in percentage rather than absolute values. (hint you can use the `dim()` function to find the number of rows and columns of a data frame.)
* How many hits have an e-value of 0 and have a percent identity less than 50?

**Excercise 9**:
What is different about those hits with an e-value of 0 and  a percent identity less than 50, as compared to those that have an e-value of 0 but a percent identity greater than or equal to 50?

**Excercise 10**:
It sometimes is useful to create a random subset of a large data set like the fly.worm results.  Create a new dataframe `fly.worm.small` that has 10,000 rows taken at random from the larger data set.

## Intro to plotting
One of the strengths of R is its graphics.  We are going to take a break from the bioninformatics datasets and work on a tutorial made by our TA Ciera.  This dataset uses the "stereotypes.xls" file available on SmartSite.  

Ciera describes the dataset as follows: 799 individuals were surveyed from ages 18 to 26 about their weekly their consumption habits. They were further categorized based on their clothing and music choices and put into four stereotypes: nerds, hipsters, metalheads, and hippies. Consumption of coffee (per cup), computer usage (hourly), showers, beers(per 12oz), and tacos. Oh yeah, this dataset is fake.

Before beginning, import the "stereotypes.xls" into an R object called "stereotypes" 

**Exercise 11**:
Use the `summary()` and `head()` functions to examine the stereotypes object.

### the subset command
In `swirl` you learned how to subset objects using square brackets [].  An alternative method is to use the `subset()` command.  To learn about the subset command, go to [Ciera's tutorial](http://cierareports.org/blog/2013/10/18/rCourse2013/index.html) and scroll down until you get to the part on subset() (It is near "Question 1".  Work through the tutorial section on subsetting.  Record the answers to your "activity breaks" in your R script.

### Plotting tutorial
Now that you know about `subsetting`, it is time to follow the plotting tutorial.

Please follow the visualization part of [Ciera's tutorial](http://cierareports.org/blog/2013/10/18/rCourse2013/index.html#section2).  You can stop when you get to "Basic Statistics".  Record the answers to your "activity breaks" in your R script.

Remember to save your R script.

### Visualization of the BLAST data set
Now lets apply what we have learned to the BLAST data set.

**Exercise 12**
Use ggplot to explore the relationship between score ("S") and alignment length("align_length").  Provide a plot that illustrates the relationship and describe the relationship in words.

**Excercise 13**
While you might expect that BLAST results with long alignments would have high scores, this is not always the case.  Form a hypothesis as to what might influence the relationship between alignment length and score.  Use ggplot to make a new plot to explore this hypothesis.  Does the plot support your hypothesis or not?  State your hypothesis, provide the code for your plot, and state your conclusion.

## Turning in your assignment.
On Friday Ciera will teach us about R Markdown.  Once you have learned about R Markdown, use it to create a report that has your answsers to the above exercises.
